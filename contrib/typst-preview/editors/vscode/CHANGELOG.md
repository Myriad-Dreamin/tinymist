## v0.6.3 - [2023-07-29]

This is a **significant enhancement** of previewing document in `onType` mode in terms of resource savings and response time for changes.
- Cross jump between code and preview (#36): We implement SyncTeX-like feature for typst-preview. You can now click on the preview panel to jump to the corresponding code location, and vice versa.
