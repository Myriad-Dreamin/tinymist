/// The [`textDocument/codeAction`] request is sent from the client to the
/// server to compute commands for a given text document and range. These
/// commands are typically code fixes to either fix problems or to
/// beautify/refactor code.
///
/// The result of a [`textDocument/codeAction`] request is an array of `Command`
/// literals which are typically presented in the user interface.
///
/// [`textDocument/codeAction`]: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_codeAction
///
/// To ensure that a server is useful in many clients, the commands specified in
/// a code actions should be handled by the server and not by the client (see
/// [`workspace/executeCommand`] and
/// `ServerCapabilities::execute_command_provider`). If the client supports
/// providing edits with a code action, then the mode should be used.
///
/// When the command is selected the server should be contacted again (via the
/// [`workspace/executeCommand`] request) to execute the command.
///
/// [`workspace/executeCommand`]: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_executeCommand
///
/// # Compatibility
///
/// ## Since version 3.16.0
///
/// A client can offer a server to delay the computation of code action
/// properties during a `textDocument/codeAction` request. This is useful for
/// cases where it is expensive to compute the value of a property (for example,
/// the `edit` property).
///
/// Clients signal this through the `code_action.resolve_support` client
/// capability which lists all properties a client can resolve lazily. The
/// server capability `code_action_provider.resolve_provider` signals that a
/// server will offer a `codeAction/resolve` route.
///
/// To help servers uniquely identify a code action in the resolve request, a
/// code action literal may optionally carry a `data` property. This is also
/// guarded by an additional client capability `code_action.data_support`. In
/// general, a client should offer data support if it offers resolve support.
///
/// It should also be noted that servers shouldnâ€™t alter existing attributes of
/// a code action in a `codeAction/resolve` request.
///
/// ## Since version 3.8.0
///
/// Support for [`CodeAction`] literals to enable the following scenarios:
///
/// * The ability to directly return a workspace edit from the code action
///   request. This avoids having another server roundtrip to execute an actual
///   code action. However server providers should be aware that if the code
///   action is expensive to compute or the edits are huge it might still be
///   beneficial if the result is simply a command and the actual edit is only
///   computed when needed.
///
/// * The ability to group code actions using a kind. Clients are allowed to
///   ignore that information. However it allows them to better group code
///   action, for example, into corresponding menus (e.g. all refactor code
///   actions into a refactor menu).
