```typc
let pagebreak(
  to: none | str = none,
  weak: bool = false,
);
```


======


A manual page break.

Must not be used inside any containers.

# Example
```typ
The next page contains
more details on compound theory.
#pagebreak()

== Compound Theory
In 1984, the first ...
```

Even without manual page breaks, content will be automatically paginated
based on the configured page size. You can set [the page height](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-height)
to `auto` to let the page grow dynamically until a manual page break
occurs.

Pagination tries to avoid single lines of text at the top or bottom of a
page (these are called _widows_ and _orphans_). You can adjust the
[`text.costs`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-costs) parameter to disable this behavior.

# Named Parameters

## to

```typc
type: "even" | "odd" | none
```

If given, ensures that the next page will be an even/odd page, with an
empty page in between if necessary.

```typ
#set page(height: 30pt)

First.
#pagebreak(to: "odd")
Third.
```

## weak (named)

```typc
type: bool
```

If `true`, the page break is skipped if the current page is already
empty.
