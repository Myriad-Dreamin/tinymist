# Tinymist Monaco Implementation

## Current Implementation

We've successfully implemented a basic version of the tinymist language server for Monaco Editor using WebAssembly:

1. **WASM Language Server Stub**:
   - Created a minimal `tinymist-wasm` crate that compiles to WASM
   - Implemented basic LSP methods like completions, hover, and document symbols

2. **Monaco Integration**:
   - Created `index.ts` that exposes a `createMonacoLanguageClient` function
   - Implemented a web worker in `worker.ts` to host the language server
   - Set up the proper communication channel between Monaco and the WASM language server

3. **VS Code Web Integration**:
   - Updated `extension.web.ts` to prepare for integrating the WASM-based language server
   - Set up the extension structure to support web-based LSP features

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance WASM Implementation**:
   - Integrate more of the existing Typst language analysis from other crates
   - Add syntax highlighting and semantic tokens support
   - Implement diagnostics and code actions

2. **Build System Improvements**:
   - Create proper npm package build scripts
   - Set up automated testing for the WASM implementation

3. **VS Code Web Integration**:
   - Complete the integration of the WASM language server into VS Code Web
   - Add support for previewing Typst documents in the browser

4. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Create examples of using tinymist-monaco in web applications
   - Document the API and usage patterns

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile and optimize the WASM language server for better performance
   - Consider using Web Workers more effectively for background processing

## Known Issues

1. The current implementation provides only basic LSP features
2. Integration with VS Code Web extension is not yet complete
3. Error handling needs improvement in the WASM module
