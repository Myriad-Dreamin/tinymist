## Release Cycle

Tinymist follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme. The version number is in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The release cycle is as follows:
- If there is a typst version update, a new major or minor version will be released intermediately. This means tinymist will always align the minor version with typst.
- If there is at least a bug or feature added this week, a new patch version will be released.

## Packaging

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/tinymist.svg)](https://repology.org/project/tinymist/versions)

## Roadmap

After development for two months, most of the features are implemented. There are still some features to be implemented, but I would like to leave them in typst v0.12.0. I'll also pick some of them to implement on my weekends. Also please feel free to contribute if you are interested in the following features.

- Documentation and refactoring: It is my current focus.
- Spell checking: There is already a branch but no suitable (default) spell checking library is found.
- Periscope renderer: It is disabled since vscode reject to render SVGs containing foreignObjects.
- Inlay hint: It is disabled _by default_ because of performance issues.
- Find references of labels, dictionary fields, and named function arguments.
- Go to definition of dictionary fields and named function arguments.
- Autocompletion for raw language tags.
- Improve symbol view's appearance.
