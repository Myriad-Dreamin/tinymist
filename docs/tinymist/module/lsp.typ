== Architecture

Tinymist binary has multiple modes, and it may runs multiple actors in background. The actors could run as an async task, in a single thread, or in an isolated process.

The main process of tinymist runs the program as a language server, through stdin and stdout. A main process will fork:
- rendering actors to provide PDF export with watching.
- preview actors that give a document/outline preview over some typst source file.
- compiler actors to provide language APIs.

From the directory structure of `crates/tinymist`, the `main.rs` file parses the command line arguments and starts commands:

```rust
match args.command.unwrap_or_default() {
    Commands::Query(query_cmds) => query_main(query_cmds),
    Commands::Lsp(args) => lsp_main(args),
    Commands::TraceLsp(args) => trace_lsp_main(args),
    Commands::Preview(args) => tokio_runtime.block_on(preview_main(args)),
    Commands::Probe => Ok(()),
}
```

The `query` subcommand contains the query commands, which are used to perform language queries via cli, which is convenient for debugging and profiling single query of the language server.

There are three servers in the `server` directory:
- `lsp` provides the language server, initialized by `lsp_main` in `main.rs`.
- `trace` provides the trace server (profiling typst programs), initialized by `trace_lsp_main` in `main.rs`.
- `preview` provides a `typst-preview` compatible preview server, initialized by `preview_main` in `tool/preview.rs`.

The long-running servers are contributed by the `LanguageState` in the `server.rs` file.

They will bootstrap actors in the `actor` directory and start tasks in the `task` directory.

They can construct and return resources in the `resource` directory.

They may invoke tools in the `tool` directory.

== Debugging with input mirroring

You can record the input during running the editors with Tinymist. You can then replay the input to debug the language server.

```sh
# Record the input
tinymist lsp --mirror input.txt
# Replay the input
tinymist lsp --replay input.txt
```

== Analyze memory usage with DHAT

You can build the program with `dhat-heap` feature to collect memory usage with DHAT. The DHAT will instrument the allocator dynamically, so it will slow down the program significantly.

```sh
cargo build --release --bin tinymist --features dhat-heap
```

The instrumented program is nothing different from the normal program, so you can mine the specific memory usage with a lsp session (recorded with `--mirror`) by replaying the input.

```sh
./target/release/tinymist lsp --replay input.txt
...
dhat: Total:     740,668,176 bytes in 1,646,987 blocks
dhat: At t-gmax: 264,604,009 bytes in 317,241 blocks
dhat: At t-end:  259,597,420 bytes in 313,588 blocks
dhat: The data has been saved to dhat-heap.json, and is viewable with dhat/dh_view.html
```

Once you have the `dhat-heap.json`, you can visualize the memory usage with #link("https://nnethercote.github.io/dh_view/dh_view.html")[the DHAT viewer].
