== Roadmap

=== Short Terms

To encourage contributions, we create many #link("https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pulls")[Pull Requests] in draft to navigate short-term plans. They give you a hint of what or where to start in this large repository.

=== Long Terms

We are planning to implement the following features in typst v0.14.0 or spare time in weekend:

- Type checking: complete the type checker.
- Static Linter: linting code statically according to feedback of the type checker and succeeding code analysis.
- Periscope renderer: It is disabled since vscode reject to render SVGs containing foreignObjects.
- Inlay hint: It is disabled _by default_ because of performance issues.
- Find references of dictionary fields and named function arguments.
- Improve symbol view's appearance.
- Improve package view.
  - Navigate to symbols by clicking on the symbol name in the view.
  - Automatically locate the symbol item in the view when viewing local documentation.
  - Remember the recently invoked package commands, e.g. "Open Docs of \@preview/cetz:0.3.1", "Open directory of \@preview/touying:0.5.3".
- Improve label view.
  - Group labels.
  - Search labels.
  - Keep (persist) group preferences.
- Improve Typst Preview.
  - Preview for all editors: See #link("https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/issues/1237")[Issue 1237].
  - Pin drop-down: Set the file to preview in the drop-down for clients that doesn't support passing arguments to the preview command.
  - Render in web worker (another thread) to reduce overhead on the electron's main thread.
- #strike[Spell checking: There is already a branch but no suitable (default) spell checking library is found.]
  - #link("https://github.com/crate-ci/typos")[typos] is great for typst. #link("harper")[harper] looks promise.

If you are interested by any above features, please feel free to send Issues to discuss or PRs to implement to #link("https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist")[GitHub.]
