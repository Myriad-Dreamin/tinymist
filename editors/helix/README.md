# Tinymist Helix Support for Typst

Run and configure tinymist in helix for Typst.

## Features

See [Tinymist Features](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist#features) for a list of features.


## Finding Executable

To enable LSP, you must install `tinymist`. You can find `tinymist` by:

- Night versions available at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/actions).

- Stable versions available at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/releases). 

  If you are using the latest version of
  [typst-ts-mode](https://codeberg.org/meow_king/typst-ts-mode), then
  you can use command `typst-ts-lsp-download-binary` to download the latest
  stable binary of `tinymist` at `typst-ts-lsp-download-path`.

- Build from source by cargo.
  You can also compile and install **latest** `tinymist` by [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

  ```bash
  cargo install --git https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist --locked tinymist
  ```


## Setup Server

Update `.config/helix/languages.toml` to use tinymist.

```toml
[language-server.tinymist]
command = "tinymist"

[[language]]
name = "typst"
language-servers = ["tinymist"]
```

## Tips

### Getting Preview Feature

[Default Preview Feature](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist//feature/preview.html) and [Background Preview Feature](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist//feature/preview.html) are suitable in helix.

### Working with Multiple-File Projects

There is a way in [Neovim](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/main/editors/neovim/README.md#multiple-file-project-support), but you cannot invoke related commands with arguments by [:lsp-workspace-command](https://docs.helix-editor.com/commands.html) in helix. As a candidate solution, assuming your having following directory layout:

```plain
├── .helix
│   └── languages.toml
└── main.typ
```

You could create .helix/languages.toml in the project folder with the following contents:

```toml
[language-server.tinymist.config]
typstExtraArgs = ["main.typ"]
```

Then all diagnostics and autocompletion will be computed according to the `main.typ`.

Note: With that configuration, if you’re seeing a file that is not reachable by `main.typ`, you will not get diagnostics and autocompletion correctly in that file.

## Extra Settings

To configure language server, you can edit the `language-server.tinymist` section. For example, if you want to export PDF on typing and output files in `$root_dir/target` directory:

```toml
[language-server.tinymist]
command = "tinymist"
config = { exportPdf = "onType", outputPath = "$root/target/$dir/$name" }
```

See [Tinymist Server Configuration](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/main/editors/neovim/Configuration.md)
for references.
