# Tinymist Sublime Support for Typst

Follow the instructions in the [sublimelsp documentation](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP/blob/main/docs/src/language_servers.md#tinymist) to make it work.

## Getting Preview Feature

[Default Preview Feature](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/feature/preview.html) and [Background Preview Feature](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/feature/preview.html) are suitable in Sublime Text.

### Working under Power-Saving Mode or with Resource-consumed Projects

When working under power-saving mode or with resource-consumed projects, typst compilations costs too much CPU and memory resources. You can configure the extension to run in syntax only mode, i.e. only performing elementary tasks, like syntax checking, syntax-only code analysis and formatting by setting the `tinymist.syntaxOnly` to `enable` or `onPowerSaving` in the configuration.

For more information about power-saving mode, see [Syntax-Only Mode](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/feature/syntax-only-mode.html).
