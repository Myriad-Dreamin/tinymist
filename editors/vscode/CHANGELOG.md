**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/compare/v0.13.6...v0.13.8

## v0.13.6 - [2025-03-13]

We has provided more ways of previewing documents for editors having poor lsp support.
- Default Preview: The editors supporting lsp commands, e.g. Neovim and helix, can use [`tinymist.startDefaultPreview`](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/feature/preview.html#label-default-preview) to start a browsing preview server directly.
- Background Preview: The editors not supporting lsp commands can use the [background preview](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/feature/preview.html#label-background-preview) feature to start a preview server in background. You can bind a shortcut editor to open the preview in browser.

See the [Issue: Preview feature for all editors](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/issues/1237) for unimplemented features.

* Provided tinymist documentation in PDF format in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1485

### Compiler

* (Fix) Getting task options from configuration in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1449
* (Fix) Displaying `ProjectInsId` without quoting in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1476
  * This made document summary not working.
* (Perf) Parallelizing and synchronously waiting font loading in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1470

### Code Analysis

* (Fix) Identifying chained dot access when matching atomic expression in markup mode in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1488 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1489
  * When completing `#a.b.|`, the second `.` was viewed as a text dot and failed to trigger the field completion. It now reparses correctly.
* Made file type recognition by file extension case-insensitive in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1472
  * For example, `IMAGE.PNG` is recognized as an image file now.

### Editor

* (Fix) Combining VS Code language specific default settings into one block by @0risc in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1462

### Completion

* (Fix) Skipping argument completion when the cursor is on the right parenthesis in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1480
* (Fix) Distinguished content value from content type in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1482
  * `math.op("+")` was wrongly inferred as an element function (type), instead of a value having the element type.
* Adjusting range of label and reference completions in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1443 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1444
  * It becomes more sensible when you request completions from anywhere on the labels or references.
* Unifying and improving function and method completion in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1478
  * The was affecting `show outline.entry`. It was completing `e|` as `entry()` instead of `entry`.
* Skip completion of types having no constructors or scopes in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1481
  * For example, `content` is not completed.
* Completing `std` module in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1483
  * `std` is in neither global scope nor math scope, so we have to handle it manually.
* Accepting arbitrary expressions in show rules in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1484
  * For example, `show: s|` now can be completed as `show: std|`, and so that further completed as `show: std.scale(..)`. It was not working because modules were filtered out as not a valid show transform function.

### Preview

* Added support to run preview server in background in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1233
* Added `tinymist.startDefaultPreview` and revised documentation about preview in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1448

[typst/typst 0.13 changelog (#5801)](https://github.com/typst/typst/commit/4a9a5d2716fc91f60734769eb001aef32fe15403).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/compare/v0.12.19...v0.12.21

## v0.12.20 - [2025-02-21]

We massively changed the internal world implementation. This unblocks many new features:
- It computes dependencies of compilation accurately. It was not correct because compilations and analyzers runs on a same world at the same time.
- It only compiles documents when file changes really affect the compilation, because we now tracks dependencies correctly.
- It now adds new project model with a `tinymist.lock` to help manage documents and their dependencies on large multiple-files projects. This is still experimental and disabled by default.
- The `tinymist.lock` along with the browsing preview is expected to greatly help people work on large and complex projects using any of their faviorite editors.

For `tinymist.lock` feature, please check the [tinymist.projectResolution = "lockDatabase"](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/blob/main/editors/vscode/Configuration.md#tinymistprojectresolution). This is still experimental for multiple-files projects.

* Bumped `cc` to v1.2.11 (#1162) in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1258
* Downgraded `tempfile` to v3.15.0 in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1259

### CLI

* Added CLI compile command in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1193 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1218
  * The compile command is mainly used for compiling documents with updating lock file. Using:

  ```
  tinymist compile --save-lock tinymist.lock
  ```
  * This could also be used for comparing the coompile performance of `tinymist-cli` and `typst-cli`.
* Generating shell build script according to the lock file in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1219

### Compiler

* (Fix) Fixed a panic when getting font index which is hit by comemo in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1213
  * This could be true when the fonts are hot reloaded.
* (Fix) Emitting latest status and artifact with correct signals (#1294) in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1330
  * Because of this, the compile status bar was not updated correctly.
* (Perf) Detecting compilation-related vfs changes in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1199
* (Perf) Scatter-gathering the editor diagnostics in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1246

* Reduced size of the watch entry in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1190 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1191
* Tracking fine-grained revisions of `font`, `registry`, `entry`, and `vfs` in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1192
  * This prepares for better configuration hot reloading in future.
* Triggering project compilations on main thread in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1197
  * This helps apply more advanced compilation strategy with sync and mutable state on the main thread. For example, [Filtering out unrelated file changes](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1199) has been applied.
### Editor

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/compare/v0.12.18...v0.12.19

## v0.12.18 - [2025-01-09]

We have added maintainers to GitHub since 2025-01-09:
- @SylvanFranklin has become a maintainer of the "Editor integration" and "Document Previewing" feature in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1091

After a super long time of development, we have finished an usable typst grammar for VS Code and GitHub. The grammar can now successfully parse all code, markup and math syntax of source files from [typst/packages (1200k LoCs)](https://github.com/typst/packages) and [typst/typst (17k LoCs)](https://github.com/typst/typst) without failure. A failure means the grammar produces any visible parse error but the official parser doesn't complain. However, it can still only parse a subset of typst syntax correctly:
- For example, all braces in `#if {}=={}{}{}` (without spaces) are identified as code braces.
- For example, It hasn't identified the ";" syntax in math calls.
But I believe it will not affect us much `:)`.

Most importantly, ideally GitHub will use the grammar to highlight typst code on GitHub in next season. It would be appreciated if people could check and test the grammar before GitHub's integration. the grammar and two ways to test it:

- The grammar: https://github.com/michidk/typst-grammar/blob/main/grammars/typst.tmLanguage.json
- Run Grammar's [snapshot tests](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/main/syntaxes/textmate#testing) and GitHub's [integration tests](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/main/syntaxes/textmate#github-integration).
- Install tinymist and check syntax highlight of [typst/packages](https://github.dev/typst/packages) in VS Code Web.
