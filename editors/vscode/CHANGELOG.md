## v0.12.21 - [2025-02-20]

Nightly Release at [feat: split tinymist-task (#1277)](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/commit/3799db6dd4b3a6504fe295ff74d6e82cc57d16bf), using [ParaN3xus/typst tinymist-nightly-v0.12.21-content-hint](https://github.com/ParaN3xus/typst/tree/tinymist-nightly-v0.12.21-content-hint), a.k.a. [typst/typst 0.13 changelog (#5801)](https://github.com/typst/typst/commit/4a9a5d2716fc91f60734769eb001aef32fe15403).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/compare/v0.12.19...v0.12.21

## v0.12.20 - [2025-02-21]

We massively changed the internal world implementation. This unblocks many new features:
- It computes dependencies of compilation accurately. It was not correct because compilations and analyzers runs on a same world at the same time.
- It only compiles documents when file changes really affect the compilation, because we now tracks dependencies correctly.
- It now adds new project model with a `tinymist.lock` to help manage documents and their dependencies on large multiple-files projects. This is still experimental and disabled by default.
- The `tinymist.lock` along with the browsing preview is expected to greatly help people work on large and complex projects using any of their faviorite editors.

For `tinymist.lock` feature, please check the [tinymist.projectResolution = "lockDatabase"](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/blob/main/editors/vscode/Configuration.md#tinymistprojectresolution). This is still experimental for multiple-files projects.

* Bumped `cc` to v1.2.11 (#1162) in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1258
* Downgraded `tempfile` to v3.15.0 in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1259
* Bumped typstyle to v0.12.15 by @Eric-Song-Nop in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1260 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1324

### CLI

* Added CLI compile command in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1193 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1218
  * The compile command is mainly used for compiling documents with updating lock file. Using:

  ```
  tinymist compile --save-lock tinymist.lock
  ```
  * This could also be used for comparing the coompile performance of `tinymist-cli` and `typst-cli`.
* Generating shell build script according to the lock file in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1219

### Compiler

* (Fix) Fixed a panic when getting font index which is hit by comemo in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1213
  * This could be true when the fonts are hot reloaded.
* (Fix) Emiting latest status and artifact with correct signals (#1294) in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1330
  * Because of this, the compile status bar was not updated correctly.
* (Perf) Detecting compilation-related vfs changes in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1199
* (Perf) Scatter-gathering the editor diagnostics in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1246
* Moved world implementation to tinymist in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1177, https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1183, https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1185, https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1186, and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1187
* Reduced size of the watch entry in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1190 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1191
* Tracking fine-grained revisions of `font`, `registry`, `entry`, and `vfs` in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1192
  * This prepares for better configuration hot reloading in future.
* Triggering project compilations on main thread in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1197
  * This helps apply more advanced compilation strategy with sync and mutable state on the main thread. For example, [Filtering out unreleated file changes](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1199) has been applied.
### Editor

* Showing name of the compiling file in the status bar in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1147
  * You can customize it by setting `tinymist.statusBarFormat` in the settings.

* Canceling codelens if any picker is cancelled in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1314

### Label View

### Typlite

* Embedding Markdown codes by `typlite` raw block by @hongjr03 in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1296 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1323
* Rendering context block contextually by @hongjr03 in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1305

### Preview

## v0.12.19 - [2025-02-03]

Nightly Release at [feat: generate declarative project lock file (#1133)](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/commit/bdfc1ed648f040b1c552d43f8ee7c9e9c882544e), using [ParaN3xus/typst tinymist-nightly-v0.12.19-rc2-content-hint](https://github.com/ParaN3xus/typst/tree/tinymist-nightly-v0.12.19-rc2-content-hint), a.k.a. [typst/typst Support first-line-indent for every paragraph (#5768)](https://github.com/typst/typst/commit/85d177897468165b93056947a80086b2f84d815d).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/compare/v0.12.18...v0.12.19

## v0.12.18 - [2025-01-09]

We have added maintainers to GitHub since 2025-01-09:
- @SylvanFranklin has become a maintainer of the "Editor integration" and "Document Previewing" feature in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1091

After a super long time of development, we have finished an usable typst grammar for VS Code and GitHub. The grammar can now successfully parse all code, markup and math syntax of source files from [typst/packages (1200k LoCs)](https://github.com/typst/packages) and [typst/typst (17k LoCs)](https://github.com/typst/typst) without failure. A failure means the grammar produces any visible parse error but the official parser doesn't complain. However, it can still only parse a subset of typst syntax correctly:
- For example, all braces in `#if {}=={}{}{}` (without spaces) are identified as code braces.
- For example, It hasn't identified the ";" syntax in math calls.
But I believe it will not affect us much `:)`.

Most importantly, ideally GitHub will use the grammar to highlight typst code on GitHub in next season. It would be appreciated if people could check and test the grammar before GitHub's integration. the grammar and two ways to test it:

- The grammar: https://github.com/michidk/typst-grammar/blob/main/grammars/typst.tmLanguage.json
- Run Grammar's [snapshot tests](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/main/syntaxes/textmate#testing) and GitHub's [integration tests](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/main/syntaxes/textmate#github-integration).
- Install tinymist and check syntax highlight of [typst/packages](https://github.dev/typst/packages) in VS Code Web.
