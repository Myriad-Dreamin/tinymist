# Tinymist Typst VS Code Extension

A VS Code or VS Codium extension for Typst. You can find the extension on:

- Night versions available at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/actions).
- Stable versions available at [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist).
- Stable versions available at [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/myriad-dreamin/tinymist).

## Features

See [Tinymist Features](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist#features) for a list of features.

## Usage Tips

### Initializing with a Template

To initialize a Typst project:
- Use command `Typst init template` (tinymist.initTemplate) to initialize a new Typst project based on a template.
- Use command `Typst show template` (tinymist.showTemplateGallery) to show available Typst templates for picking up a template to initialize.


ðŸŽ‰ If your template contains only a single file, you can also insert the template content in place with command:
- Use command `Typst template in place` (tinymist.initTemplateInPlace) and input a template specifier for initialization.

### Configuring LSP-enhanced formatters

1. Open settings.
1. Search for "Tinymist Formatter" and modify the value.
  - Use `"formatterMode": "typstyle"` for [typstyle](https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typstyle).
  - Use `"formatterMode": "typstfmt"` for [typstfmt](https://github.com/astrale-sharp/typstfmt).

Tips: to enable formatting on save, you should add extra settings for typst language:

```json
{
  "[typst]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  }
}
```

### Configuring/Using Tinymistâ€™s Activity Bar (Sidebar)

If you donâ€™t like the activity bar, you can right-click on the activity bar and uncheck "Tinymist" to hide it.

#### Symbol View

- Search symbols by keywords, descriptions, or handwriting.
- See symbols grouped by categories.
- Click on a symbol, then it will be inserted into the editor.

#### Preview Command

Open command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), and type `>Typst Preview:`.

You can also use the shortcut (Ctrl+K V).

#### Theme-aware template (previewing)

In short, there is a `sys.inputs` item added to the compiler when your document is under the context of _user editing or previewing task_. You can use it to configure your template:

```typ
#let preview-args = json.decode(sys.inputs.at("x-preview", default: "{}"))
// One is previewing the document.
#let is-preview = sys.inputs.has("x-preview")
// `dark` or `light`
#let preview-theme = preview-args.at("theme", default: "light")
```

For details, please check [Previewâ€™s sys.inputs](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/feature/preview.html#label-sys.inputs).

### Configuring path to search fonts

To configure path to search fonts:
1. Open settings.
  - File -\> Preferences -\> Settings (Linux, Windows).
  - Code -\> Preferences -\> Settings (Mac).
1. Search for "Tinymist Font Paths" for providing paths to search fonts order-by-order.
1. Search for "Tinymist System Fonts" for disabling system fonts to be searched, which is useful for reproducible rendering your PDF documents.
1. Reload the window or restart the vscode editor to make the settings take effect.


**Note:** you must provide absolute paths.
**Note:** you can use vscode variables in the settings, see [vscode-variables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-variables) for more information.

### Configuring path to root directory

To configure the root path resolved for Typst compiler:
1. Open settings.
1. Search for "Tinymist Root Path" and modify the value.
1. Reload the window or restart the vscode editor to make the settings take effect. **Note:** you must provide absolute paths.

### Compiling PDF

This extension compiles to PDF, but it doesnâ€™t have a PDF viewer yet. To view the output as you work, install a PDF viewer extension, such as `vscode-pdf`.

To find a way to compile PDF:
- Click the code len `Export PDF` at the top of document, or use command `Typst Show PDF ...`, to show the current document to PDF.
- Use command `Typst Export PDF` to export the current document to PDF.
- There are code lens buttons at the start of the document to export your document to PDF or other formats.

To configure when PDFs are compiled:
1. Open settings.
1. Search for "Tinymist Export PDF".
1. Change the "Export PDF" setting.
  - `onSave` makes a PDF after saving the Typst file.
  - `onType` makes PDF files live, as you type.
  - `never` disables PDF compilation.
  - `onDocumentHasTitle` makes a PDF when the document has a title and, as you save.

To configure where PDFs are saved:

1. Open settings.
1. Search for "Tinymist Output Path".
1. Change the "Output Path" setting. This is the path pattern to store
  artifacts, you can use `$root` or `$dir` or `$name` to do magic
  configuration
  - e.g. `$root/$dir/$name` (default) for `$root/path/to/main.pdf`.
  - e.g. `$root/target/$dir/$name` for `$root/target/path/to/main.pdf`.
  - e.g. `$root/target/foo` for `$root/target/foo.pdf`. This will ensure
    that the output is always output to `target/foo.pdf`.

**Note:** the output path should be substituted as an absolute path.

### Exporting to Other Formats

You can export your documents to various other formats by lsp as well.
Currently, the following formats are supported:
- Official svg, png, and pdf.
- Unofficial html, md (typlite), and txt
- Query Results (into json, yaml, or txt), and pdfpc (by `typst query --selector <pdfpc-file>`, for [Touying](https://touying-typ.github.io/touying/))

See
[Docs: Exporting Documents](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/feature/export.html)
for more information.

### Working with Multiple-File Projects

You can pin a main file by command.
- Use command `Typst Pin Main` (tinymist.pinMainToCurrent) to set the current file as the main file.
- Use command `Typst Unpin Main` (tinymist.unpinMain) to unset the main file.

> [!NOTE]
> 
>   `tinymist.pinMain` is a stateful command, and tinymist doesn't remember it between sessions (closing and opening the editor).


### Passing Extra CLI Arguments

There is a **global** configuration `tinymist.typstExtraArgs` to pass extra arguments to tinymist LSP, like what you usually do with `typst-cli` CLI. For example, you can set it to `["--input=awa=1", "--input=abaaba=2", "main.typ"]` to configure `sys.inputs` and entry for compiler, which is equivalent to make LSP run like a `typst-cli` with such arguments:

```
typst watch --input=awa=1 --input=abaaba=2 main.typ
```

Supported arguments:
- entry file: The last string in the array will be treated as the entry file.
  - This is used to specify the **default** entry file for the compiler, which may be overridden by other settings.
- `--input`: Add a string key-value pair visible through `sys.inputs`.
- `--font-path` (environment variable: `TYPST_FONT_PATHS`), Font paths, maybe overriden by `tinymist.fontPaths`.
- `--ignore-system-fonts`: Ensures system fonts wonâ€™t be searched, maybe overriden by `tinymist.systemFonts`.
- `--creation-timestamp` (environment variable: `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`): The documentâ€™s creation date formatted as a [UNIX timestamp](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/).

**Note:** Fix entry to `main.typ` may help multiple-file projects
but you may loss diagnostics and autocompletions in unrelated files.

**Note:** the arguments has quite low priority, and that may be overridden
by other settings.
